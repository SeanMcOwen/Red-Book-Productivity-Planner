The Red Book Productivity Planner is a work in progress application for keeping track of habits, goals and tasks. 

<h2>Creating a goal</h2>
<p>First, create a group and a progress object (found in the create section). The group will be used for tracking similar goals, habits and tasks. The progress object is used to manage the progress of a goal. Because we may have multiple goals for the same thing we are tracking (such as a goal to do 50 hours of studying over the next year, but 150 of the next two years), we use the progress object to keep track of overall progress.</p>
